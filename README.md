## The Game
 The Door is a horror game where you need to help Noah Bennet get out of the maze. Be very careful with the Executioner, as just one hit can kill you.
Use the 'a', 's', 'd' and 'w' keys on your keyboard to move the character. Hold down the 'shift' key to run. Use the mouse to move the camera. Use the left mouse button to shoot. Use the 'e' key to interact with objects.


## Details
### 3D Player and Enemy Animation:
- Fluid and realistic animations for Noah Bennet, including walking, running, shooting, and interacting with objects.
- Scary and threatening animations for the Executioner, highlighting its lethality.

### Object Interaction:
- Implement the ability for Noah to interact with various objects in the environment, such as doors, keys, levers, and healing items.
- Environmental puzzles that require player interaction to solve and progress in the game.

### User Interfaces:
- Minimalist HUD showing Noah's health, ammunition, and collected items.
- Visual and auditory indicators alerting the player to the Executioner's proximity.

### Navigation AI:
- Artificial intelligence for the Executioner, allowing it to navigate the labyrinth and pursue Noah intelligently and unpredictably.
- Implementation of safe areas where Noah can temporarily hide from the Executioner.

### Image Post-processing:
- Use of post-processing effects to create a dark and oppressive atmosphere, including motion blur, film grain, and lighting adjustments.
- Special visual effects when Noah is detected or attacked by the Executioner.

### Platform Movement:
- Intuitive movements allowing the player to move forward, backward, and jump (if necessary).
- Integration with tilesets and palettes to create detailed and visually attractive maps, providing a rich and varied environment.

### Lighting with Unity Render Pipeline:
- Dark environments with dynamic lighting, highlighting only the light from Noah's torch and the fire ghosts.
- Light and shadow effects that enhance tension and immersion in the game.

## Game Writing
Noah wakes up with a splitting headache and finds himself in an unfamiliar, dark environment. When he opens his eyes, he realizes he is trapped in a maze-like building. The walls are made of cold, damp stone, and the air is heavy and oppressive.

As he explores the maze, Noah finds some chests scattered throughout the corridors. Inside the first chest, he finds a rusty lamp, which, luckily, still works. The dim light from the lamp gives him a bit of hope and allows him to see the path ahead better.

As he advances through the maze, Noah begins to hear an unsettling sound: the distant roar of a chainsaw. His heart races as he realizes he is not alone. A man, known as "The Executioner", is in the maze, armed with a chainsaw and intent on eliminating any intruders. Noah must be extremely cautious to avoid fatal encounters.

Noah finds another chest. This time, he finds a pistol, placed there by some crazy entity that captured Noah and placed him in that place. Noah Bennett, a talented young architect, was investigating an ancient and evil sect that practiced dark rituals. Before he could expose their secrets, he was captured, knocked unconscious and thrown into a sinister labyrinth.

Noah must investigate the labyrinth, find the key to the only door in the labyrinth. However, he must do this in a way that avoids encountering the Executioner, because with just one hit, it's GAME OVER!
